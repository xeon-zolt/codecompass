## üåü Features

CodeCompass provides a multi-dimensional view of your codebase, represented by compass directions:

-   **üß≠ North**: Identifies authors who introduced the most lint issues.
-   **üß≠ South**: Highlights files with the highest number of linting problems.
-   **üß≠ East**: Shows the most frequently violated ESLint rules.
-   **üß≠ West**: Ranks files by their lines of code.
-   **üß≠ And more**: Provides leaderboards for commit activity, code coverage, code churn, bug density, technical debt, and spell-checking.
